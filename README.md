![Features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3af1185-9b5d-411a-8b14-60a0a21249f9)

-   **Guided navigation:** waypoint arrow, map and minimap lines, optional range checks, and flight-path helpers keep you moving without extra addons.
-   **Hands-free questing:** auto accept, auto turn-in, auto gossip, and automatic cutscene skipping to speed runs while keeping safety checks.
-   **Easy quest items:** auto-creates buttons for items and spells so you can click or keybind them without digging in your bags.
-   **Group-friendly:** shows party progress, syncs steps, and supports group quests and scenarios to keep everyone aligned.
-   **Route coverage:** curated routes across expansions, custom route imports (AprRC), and quick controls to skip, rollback, or reset if you go off track.
-   **Flexible UI:** move and scale the quest list, step list, waypoint arrow, and minimap button to fit your layout.

### Quick tip

Hold `Ctrl`, `Shift`, or `Alt` while talking to NPCs, flight masters, or merchants to temporarily disable auto accept/turn-in/gossip, auto-flight selection, and cutscene skipping for that interaction.
