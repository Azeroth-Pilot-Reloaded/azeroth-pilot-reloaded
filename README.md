## Story 

Here's why I am continuing Azeroth Auto Pilot's development;

While using Azeroth Auto Pilot, I encountered various issues. At a point during the Warlords of Draenor campaign at level 35, I ended up coming to a hard stop due to a bug that completely broke the leveling process with the addon. I decided to go to AAP's Discord to get help, and I was told that AAP has gone unmaintained and its author/developer has ghosted their own support team. The addon has been left abandoned and, in some parts, broken, and so I was told, was way too messy for anybody to want to deal with. I was interested to see how messy it was, and believe me; it was messy!

I don't blame anyone for not wanting to touch it, but I had 8 alts to level!

Azeroth Auto Pilot's own support team suggested I take a look at the code and see what I could do with it.

You can hold ctrl right before doing something that would otherwise be automated, and it will temporarily disable the skipping of that thing, such as a cutscene.
