[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/HereBeDragons/compare/2.03-release...2.04-release) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/HereBeDragons/releases)

- Update TOC  
- Don't consider instance -1 as valid for overrides  
- Remove HereBeDragons-1.0 compat folder  
- Use C\_Minimap.GetViewRadius on WoW 9.0 instead guessing based on zoom  
    This avoids MINIMAP\_UPDATE\_ZOOM spam, which was degrading performance.  
- Migrate to GitHub actions
